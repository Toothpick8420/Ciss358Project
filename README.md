An implementation of LongInt and then Polynomials to implement Karatsuba fast multiplication. 
Then utilizing these with the tau function results in a polynomial where the coefficients of the polynomial match up 
to n+1 in the tau function, like n=3 means the first 4 coefficients match with the results of the tau function
